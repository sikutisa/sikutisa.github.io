# Synchronization Examples
## Classic Problems of Synchronization
* Examples of a large class of *Concurrency-Control* Problems
    * The **Bounded-Buffer** Problem 
        * The **Producer-Consumer** Problem
    * The **Readers-Writers** Problem
    * The **Dining-Philosophers** Problem

### The Bounded-Buffer Problem
* Recall the Producer-Consumer Problem with a pool consisting of *n buffers*, each capable of holding *one* item.
    * The producer *produces full buffers* for the consumer
    * The consumer *produces empty buffers* for the producer.

* Shared Data Structures:
    * A binary semaphore *mutex* provides *mutual exclusion* for accesses to the buffer pool and is *initialized* to the value 1.
    * Two counting semaphores *empty* and *full* are used to count the number of *empty* and *full* buffers.
        * empty is initialized to the value ùëõ, full is to the value 0.

```
int n;
semaphore mutex = 1;
semaphore empty = n;
semaphore full = 0;

/*
* The structure of the producer process
*/
while (true) {
    ...
    /* produce an item in next_produced */
    ...
    wait(empty);
    wait(mutex);
    ...
    /* add next_produced to the buffer */
    ...
    signal(mutex);
    signal(full);
}

/*
* The structure of the consumer process
*/
while (true) {
    wait(full);
    wait(mutex);
    ...
    /* remove an item from buffer to next_consumed */
    ...
    signal(mutex);
    signal(empty);
    ...
    /* consume the item in next_consumed */
    ...
}
```

### The Readers-Writers Problem
* What if the processes running concurrently are either the *readers* or the *writers* to the shared data?
    * e.g., a *database* shared among several concurrent processes.
* The *readers* may want *only to read* the database, whereas the *writers* to *update* (that is, *read and write*) the database.
* Note that, obviously, *no adverse effects* will result, if *two or more readers* access the shared data simultaneously.
* However, *chaos* may ensue, if a *writer* and some other process (either a *reader* or a *writer*) access the database simultaneously.

* Some Variations of the Readers-Writers Problem:
    * **Priorities** are involved with all the variations.
    * The **first** readers-writers problem:
        * *No reader* should *wait* for other readers to finish simply because a *writer* is *waiting*.
    * The **second** readers-writers problem:
        * If a *writer* is waiting to access the object, no new *readers* may start *reading*.
    * Note that **starvation** may occur in these two cases.

* Solution to the first readers-writers problem
    * The reader processes share the following data structures
    * rw_mutex is common to both readers and writers.
    * mutex is used to ensure *mutual exclusion* when the variable read_count is updated.
    * read_count keeps track of how many processes are currently reading the object.

```
semaphore rw_mutex = 1;
semaphore mutex = 1;
int read_count = 0;

/*
* The structure of a writer process
*/

while (true) {
    wait(rw_mutex);
    ...
    /* writing is performed */
    ...
    signal(rw_mutex);
}

/*
* The structure of a reader process
*/

while (true) {
    wait(mutex);
    read_count++;
    if (read_count == 1)
        wait(rw_mutex);
    signal(mutex);
    ...
    /* reading is performed */
    ...
    wait(mutex);
    read_count--;
    if (read_count == 0)
        signal(rw_mutex);
    signal(mutex);
}
```

* Solution to the Readers-Writers Problem:
    * Note that, if *a writer* is in the critical section, and *ùëõ readers* are waiting, then *one reader* is queued on *rw_mutex*, and *ùëõ ‚àí 1 readers* are queued on *mutex*.
    * Also observe that, when a writer executes *signal(rw_mutex)*, we may resume the execution of either the *waiting readers* or a *single waiting writer*.
        * The selection is made by the scheduler.

### The Reader-Writer Locks
* The readers-writers problem and its solutions have been generalized to provide *reader-writer locks*.
* Acquiring a reader-writer lock requires specifying the mode of the lock: either *read* or *write*.
* Note that *multiple processes* may acquire a reader-writer lock in read mode, but *only one process* may acquire the lock for writing, as exclusive access is required for writers.

## The Dining-Philosophers Problem
* Consider *five* philosophers who spend their lives *thinking* and *eating*.
    * sharing *five single chopsticks*.
* Sometimes, a philosopher gets hungry and tries to pick up *two chopsticks* that are closest to her.
* When a hungry philosopher has both *her chopsticks* at the same time, she eats *without releasing* the chopsticks.

* Need to allocate *several resources* among *several processes* in a **deadlock-free** and **starvation-free manner**.

![Philosopher](./img/1.png){: w="320" h = "320"}
*The situation of the dining philosophers*

### Semaphore Solution
* One simple solution is to represent each chopstick with a semaphore.
    * A philosopher acquires a chopstick by executing a ùë§ùëéùëñùë°() operation.
    * She releases her chopsticks by executing a ùë†ùëñùëîùëõùëéùëô() operation.

```
semaphore chopstick[5];

while (true) {
    wait(chopstick[i]);
    wait(chopstick[(i + 1) % 5]);
    ...
    /* eat for a while */
    ...
    signal(chopstick[i]);
    signal(chopstick[(i + 1) % 5]);
    ...
    /* think for a while */
    ...
}
```

* The problem of **deadlock** and **starvation**
    * Simple semaphore solution guarantees **mutual exclusion**.
    * However, how about deadlock or starvation?
        * Suppose that all five philosophers become hungry at the same time and each grabs her left chopstick, trying to grab her right chopstick.
        * Here comes a deadlock situation.

* Possible *remedies* to the deadlock problem
    * Allow *at most four philosophers* to be sitting simultaneously at the table.
    * Allow a philosopher to pick up her chopsticks only if *both chopsticks* are available.
    * Use an *asymmetric* solution
        * An *odd-numbered* philosopher picks up first her left chopstick and then her right chopstick, whereas an *even-numbered* philosopher picks up her right chopstick and the her left chopstick.
    * Note that a deadlock-free solution does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of **starvation**.

### Monitor Solution
* Let a philosopher to pick up her chopsticks only if *both* of them are *available*.
* We need to distinguish among *three states* of the philosophers: thinking, hungry, and eating. 
* A philosopher can set her state to be eating, only if her *two neighbors* are not in the state of eating.
* We also need a *condition variable* which allows a philosopher to *delay* herself when she is *hungry* but is *unable to obtain* the chopsticks she needs.

* Solution to the Dining-Philosophers Problem
    * The distribution of the chopsticks is controlled by the monitor, *DiningPhilosopher*.
    * Each philosopher must to invoke the operation ùëùùëñùëêùëòùë¢ùëù(), before starting to eat, suspending the philosopher process.
    * After the successful completion of pickup(), the philosopher may eat, and invokes the operation ùëùùë¢ùë°ùëëùëúùë§ùëõ().
    * Note that **mutual exclusion** is guaranteed and **no deadlocks** will occur, however, **starvation** is still possible.

## Thread-Safe Concurrent Applications
* *Concurrent applications* have good performance on multicore systems, using techniques such as *mutex locks*, *semaphores*, and *monitors*.
* However, they present an increased risk of **race conditions** and **liveness hazards** such as *deadlock*.
* There are alternative approaches for the design of **thread-safe** *concurrent* applications.
    1. **Transactional Memory**
    2. **OpenMP**
    3. **Functional Programming Language**
